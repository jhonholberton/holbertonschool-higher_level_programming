# JavaScript - Web scraping

## Description

Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.

Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

Web scraping is used in a variety of digital businesses that rely on data harvesting. Legitimate use cases include:

- Search engine bots crawling a site, analyzing its content and then ranking it.
- Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.
- Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).
